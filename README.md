# Contextualized Transfer Learning (CTL) Framework

This repository contains the implementation of the Contextualized Transfer Learning (CTL) framework. The CTL framework is designed to enhance transfer learning by contextualizing the learning process to better fit resource-limited environments.

## Introduction
The CTL framework is an architecture for implementing contextualized transfer learning. This repository includes:
- `CTL_Framework.py`: A program to intialize the contextualized Transfer Learning Framework
- `polytope.py`: A program for approximating the archetype dictionary size.
- `simulation.py`: A simulation script demonstrating the use of the CTL framework.

## Getting Started
To get started with the CTL framework, follow the steps below to copy the code into a Google Colab notebook and run it.

## Usage
### Running the Archetype Dictionary Size Approximation
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Create a new notebook.
3. Copy the contents of `polytope.py` from this repository and paste it into a code cell in the Colab notebook.
4. Run the cell to execute the archetype dictionary size approximation.

### Running the CTL Simulation
1. In the same or a new Colab notebook, copy the contents of `simulation.py` from this repository and paste it into a new code cell.
2. Run the cell to execute the CTL simulation.
